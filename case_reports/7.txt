<b>Case 7. RTGM22572</b><br/>

<b>History:</b>  Cavalier King Charles Spaniel, 5 years, male. Has signs of neck scratching and ataxia. <br/><br/>

<em>Interpretation guide:</em>   MRI studies typically consist of multiple series. You should set the image view to have the mouse wheel button scroll through the stack. Series 1,4,6 are T1 weighted images of the skull, series 3 and 5 are T2 weighted. Identify the scanning planes, transverse sagittal and dorsal. Notice that fat tissue on both sequences gives a bright signal (hyperintense). Fluid (that is low in protein) will be hypo-intense on T1 and hyper-intense on T2 sequences. Identify normal fluid in the lateral ventricles of the bran and see if you can find abnormal accumulations for example in the para-nasal sinuses, in the brain, or spinal cord. Use the images to refresh your knowledge of central nervous system anatomy.<br/><br/> 


<b>Findings:</b>  	The cerebellum is misshapen and projects through the foramen magnum. The spinal cord contains a central hypo-intense area on T1, hyper-intense on T2 indicating fluid. There are bilateral lesions hyper-intense on T2 in the tympanic bullae. <br/></br>

<b>Conclusions:</b>  There are two likely diagnosis in this case, syringohydromyelia and bilateral otitis media (possible chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM). <br/><br/>

<b>Comment:</b>  The final diagnosis was Chiari like malformation, syringohydromyelia and otitis media.<br/><br/><br/><br/>
