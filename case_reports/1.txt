<b>Case 1. RTGM24516</b><br/>

<b>History:</b>  8 month Labrador, female. Diagnosed with <em>Angiostrongylus</em> 3 days earlier. Coughing. <br/><br/>

<em>Interpretation guide:</em>  Try to evaluate and report on the appearance of as much anatomical detail as possible, mentioning in particular areas that are abnormal. Pay special attention to the lungs in this case. Normally you should be able to see clear well-defined pulmonary vessels. Pathology often obscures these.<br/><br/> 




<b>Findings:</b>  There is a diffuse increased pulmonary opacity. This is characterized by a loss of the normally clear vascular outlines. In addition, especially seen on the dorsoventral view, some airways are thickened due to the presence of poorly marginated soft tissue opacities.<br/></br>

<b>Conclusions:</b>  Pulmonary broncho-interstitial pattern. <br/><br/>

<b>Comment:</b>  The peribronchial changes suggest a bronchial infiltrate. A bronchial infiltrate may  infective, allergic etc in origin. This pattern of change indicates a broncho-interstitial infiltrate suggestive of a broncho-interstitial pneumonia. Given the history, a parasitic origin is likely parasitic.<br/><br/>
The final diagnosis was verminous broncho-pneumonia.<br/><br/><br/><br/>
