<b>Case 12. RTGS2874</b><br/>

<b>History:</b>   Horse, Oldenborg 7 yrs. Fever, depressed, and pain on palpation of the left mandible.<br/><br/>

<em>Interpretation guide:</em>  This series contains 3 images. Identify the projections (it appears on the bottom left of the image). Once the projection is known, you should be able to identify if the affected (left) mandible is projected, free from overlying structures. Identify normal tooth anatomy and describe any the changes seen.<br/><br/> 




<b>Findings:</b>  DV and RtV-LeD Oblique. The latter will free-project the left mandible. There are areas of lysis in the mandible, and there is loss of the clear periodontal membrane around the caudal root of 308, the third cheek tooth, left mandible. There is a gas-containing soft tissue swelling centered again at the caudal root of 308. <br/></br>

<b>Conclusions:</b>  Tooth root abscess with fistula formation <br/><br/>

<b>Comment:</b>   The signs are typical of a tooth root abscess with mandibular fistula formation. The absence of new bone formation suggests that this process is in its early stages. <br/><br/><br/><br/>
