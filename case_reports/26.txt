<b>Case 26. RTGS1806</b><br/>

<b>History:</b>  Warm Blood type horse 5 years. Gelding. Admitted to the hospital due to a swollen area with drainage at the right mandible. Tooth root disease is a common cause of mandibular swellings in horses.<br/><br/>

<em>Interpretation guide:</em>  Oblique projections are particularly useful for examining individual tooth roots. These are available for this case. Study them so you are confident that you know which dental arcade is imaged on each oblique. Identify normal tooth root anatomy and search for pathology. Teeth are normally identified in clinical records and radiological reports using a numbering system, e.g the permanent right upper central incisor is 101. Use this system to specify the location of any pathology you detect.<br/><br/> 




<b>Findings:</b>   Two oblique proj. Quality: Good. Left mandible (RtV-LeDO): Normal findings. Right mandible (LeV-RtDO): Soft tissue swelling and new bone formation of ventral mandible adjacent to 407. There is widening of the periodontal membrane and some resorption of the roots (particularly the rostral root) of 407.<br/></br>

<b>Conclusions:</b>  Tooth infection /periodontal disease 407.<br/><br/><br/><br/>
