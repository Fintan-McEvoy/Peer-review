<b>Case 16. RTGM24658</b><br/>

<b>History:</b>   English bulldog 4 yrs 8 months. Lame right hind limb for an extended period of time. Clinical exam showed instability of the right stifle. X-ray obtained prior to planned tibial tuberosity advancement (TTA) surgery of the right stifle. <br/><br/>

<em>Interpretation guide:</em>  The 5 images include pelvis and lumbar spine as well as right stifle. When you have evaluated the right stifle, go on to describe any other pathology (if present) that may have an impact on the planned surgery. <br/><br/> 




<b>Findings:</b>  Right stifle: There is a severe displacement of the intra-articular fat pad and obliteration of the facial planes caudally. A small osteophyte is seen on the distal pole of the patella. Pelvis: Severe bilateral hip dysplasia and right-sided hip arthrosis. Both acetabulae are shallow, and the head of the femur is subluxated. On the right side the head of the femur is remodeled, having a flatted articular surface. Vertebral column: From L2 to S1 there is severe bridging ventral and lateral spondylosis. The normal vertebral facet joints are obliterated due to dorsal fusion of the facet joint(s) between L4 and L5. The hemi-vertebrae (characteristic for the breed) are clearly seen in the tail.<br/></br>

<b>Conclusions:</b>   Stifle arthrosis, severe hip dysplasia, facet joint disease, ventral spondylosis, hemivertebrae<br/><br/>

<b>Comment:</b>  The extent of the pathology in this dog at locations other than the planned surgical site will cause the surgeon to re-evaluate the suitability of the patient for the procedure. <br/><br/><br/><br/>
