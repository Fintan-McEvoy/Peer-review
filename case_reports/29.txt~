<b>Case 29. RTGS2170</b><br/>

<b>History:</b>  Warmblod type horse, age 2 years. Mild lameness and chronic effusion femoro-patellar joint right hind. Traumatic event with synovitis in this joint 1Â½ years ago.<br/><br/>

<em>Interpretation guide:</em>   When viewing radiographs, all areas of the area imaged should be viewed. However, it is important also to be aware of the type, location, and pattern of disease that one might expect to encounter in each area imaged. For this case, a young horse with a stifle joint effusion and no known history of trauma, osteochrodrosis is a possibility. In the stifle, lesions associated with this disease are generally seen on the lateral trochlear ridge of the femur. OCD is less common on the medial ridge, the trochlear groove on the patella. Multiple sites may be involved. Examine these radiographs, identify any lesions. If any are found, identify their location precisely.<br/><br/> 




<b>Findings:</b>  	Seven images. One LM projection of left and six projections of right stifle in LM, DP, and oblique projections. The study is centered on the lateral trochlea. The technical quality of the pictures are acceptable, and no artefacts were detected or found to interfere with the evaluation. The lateral throchlea of femur has several defects together with subchondral radiolucent areas. Separated from the condyle, 4 or 5 mineral opacity fragments (approx.1cm each) can be seen. Another fragment is seen(2x10mm) on several projections. This might be attached to the joint capsule or be free within the joint space. <br/></br>

<b>Conclusions:</b>  OCD lateral trochlea of the femur<br/><br/><br/><br/>
