<b>Case 14. RTGM23418</b><br/>

<b>History:</b>   3 year-old Labrador. Ate an ox-bone 3 days earlier, now vomiting. ? cause of vomiting. <br/><br/>

<em>Interpretation guide:</em>  It is very unusual for bone to act as an obstructing foreign body once it has reached the stomach. Ingested bone can cause esophageal obstructions and, if sharp spicules remain, cause pain on defecation. Look at the images, is there an intestinal foreign body, if you find one determine if it is obstructing, in which part of the intestine it is located, and where within that region (proximal or distal) it is located. <br/><br/> 




<b>Findings:</b>  There is a 3 cm diameter radiopaque foreign body within the proximal small intestine. There is a length of dilated small intestine with a diameter of 4 cm containing fluid and gas, and it can be tracked to the pylorus. In this case since the dilated loop can be traced all the way to the ventricle, we can measure its length (22 cm from the pylorus.<br/></br>

<b>Conclusions:</b>   Obstructing small intestinal foreign body<br/><br/>

<b>Comment:</b>   Look at this image again, but pretend the foreign body is not radiopaque (usually they do not contrast with the bowel content so the actual foreign body is often not seen). Could you make the diagnosis of intestinal obstruction without seeing the foreign body? The key is to recognize the dilated loop of small intestine. As a rule of thumb small intestine is not normally larger than 1.5 times the smallest height of the body of the fourth lumbar vertebra. The content of the large bowel is often helpful in differentiating it from small intestine. The surgeon's feed back stated that the foreign body was a ball).<br/><br/><br/><br/>
