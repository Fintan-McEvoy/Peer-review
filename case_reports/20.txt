<b>Case 20. RTGM24413</b><br/>

<b>History:</b>   8 year old main coon cat. Depression and fits with increasing frequency.<br/><br/>

<em>Interpretation guide:</em>  <br/><br/> 




<b>Findings:</b>  Hypertrophy of right parietal bone -- at the same level a marked midline shift from right to left can be seen in the parenchyma of the brain. In T1 sequences there is an iso-intense well-marginated oval mass sized L 2cm x W 1.4cm located in the caudal part of the lat. ventricle. The right lat. ventricle cannot be seen. In the sagital images the same finding can be dectected and also a circular hypo-intense mass diameter 0.86cm making an impression in the dorsorostral part of cerebellum. There is moderate contrast enhancement in the mass located in right hemisphere. <br/></br>

<b>Conclusions:</b>  Brain tumour<br/><br/>

<b>Comment:</b>  The location suggests neoplasia of the plexus choroideus and the mass in cerebellum is most likely a pocket of CSF related to the lateral ventricle.<br/><br/><br/><br/>
