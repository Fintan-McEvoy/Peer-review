<b>Case 6. RTGM22533</b><br/>

<b>History:</b>  6 year Australian Shepard dog. Has eaten a bone earlier today and attempted to regurgitate immediately. Eating grass, will not take normal food. Has improved in the last few hours. <br/><br/>

<em>Interpretation guide:</em>   Look at both images (VD and Lat thorax). If you find any abnormality, make sure you describe it fully. That means you cover the "r&oslashntgen signs" describing the lesions size, shape, number, margin, position and radio-opacity.<br/><br/> 


<b>Findings:</b>  There is a 6 X 2 cm mineralized / bone opacity in the middle mediastinum at the heart base level. This displaces the trachea ventrally. The structure has smooth margins but has an organized trabecular / trabecular-like appearance. No evidence of pneumonia or of free mediastinal gas detected on these images.<br/></br>

<b>Conclusions:</b> Oesophageal foreign body (bone).<br/><br/></br></br>
