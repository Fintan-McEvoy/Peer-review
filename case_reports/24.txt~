<b>Case 24. RTGS1909</b><br/>

<b>History:</b> Warm blood type horse. Age: Five years. Diagnosis from referring vet: Suspect fissure fracture medial P3 right thoracic limb, five months ago. The horse was sound for five weeks, but now lame again. Blocks to the foot. <br/><br/>

<em>Interpretation guide:</em>  It is normal practice to obtain multiple view in equine radiography. Small changes can be clinically important and are easily masked by overlapping structures. One aspect of multiples projection is that different areas are projected free from overlying bone on each projection. This can assist in diagnosis. Although there are many projections, they are all from the same anatomical region. Use the multiple views to form a single opinion on the status of the various regions imaged. In this case there is a specific question about a certain pathology. This must be addressed in your response, but as always, the possibility of other, unsuspected pathology should be considered. If evidence for this is found, it should be reported. <br/><br/> 




<b>Findings:</b>  Eight images, right thoracic limb, phalanges. Quality and projections are acceptable. A low grade ossification of the lateral collateral cartilage is evident. Two LM proj. of the proximal and distal interphalangeal joints show osteophytes and enthesiophytes at dorsal P2 and P3. The upright pedal view (DPa) of P3 and the palmaroproximal- palmarodistal views of the navicular bone show 9 nutrient foramina. The navicular bone has an acceptable outline without obvious spurs and a clear border between cortex and marrow with no signs of sclerosis. No convincing sign of P3 fissure fracture at this stage.<br/></br>

<b>Conclusions:</b> Osteoarthrosis P1/P2, P2/P3 joints right thoracic limb.<br/><br/><br/><br/>
