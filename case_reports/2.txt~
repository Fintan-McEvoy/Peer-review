<b>Case 2. RTGM17014</b><br/>

<em>Interpretation guide:</em>   Examine the entire set of radiographs. Search for normal structures and report on any abnormalities you find. Localizations is very important. If you do see changes, suggest where they are located. Be specific and relate them to anatomy rather than their location on the image. So for example when noticing a rib lesion, write that it involves the 2nd rib right side rather than stating that it is seen on the bottom left of the image. If it is a rib state what part, e.g. the costo-chondral joint, the rib head the body of the rib , cortex medulla, periostium, or endostium. Often one cannot be so exact but you should try. Localization is important.<br/><br/> 




<b>Findings:</b>  There are multiple pulmonary masses. At least 6 are seen in the right lungs and two in the left. The masses are uniform soft tissue in opacity with smooth margins, spherical in shape, and 5 to 7 cm in diameter. Images show a nodular interstitial pattern, typical of large pulmonary metastasis.<br/></br>

<b>Conclusions:</b>  Metastatic disease is likely. <br/><br/>

<b>Comment:</b>  The final diagnosis was metastatic pulmonary disease.<br/><br/><br/><br/>
