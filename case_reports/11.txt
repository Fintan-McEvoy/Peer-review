<b>Case 11. RTGM24637</b><br/>

<b>History:</b>  French bulldog 5 years. Back pain, suspect intervertebral disc disease.<br/><br/>

<em>Interpretation guide:</em>  CT is useful for detecting cord compression due to mineralized disc material. The mineralization process helps provide contrast so that the prolapsed disc material contrasts with the spinal cord. Some protocols for this exam will suggest that myelography is performed at the same time. Examine the spine images, identify the body, lamella, articular facets of the vertebrae.<br/><br/> 




<b>Findings:</b>  	There is mineralised inter-vertebral disc material at L2/L3, L3/L4 and at L4/L5. The main bulk of the prolapsed material is present on the right side at L4/L5. Multiple vertebrae are misshapen. <br/></br>

<b>Conclusions:</b>   <br/>Intervertebral disc prolapse and severe vertebral malformations (breed associated).<br/><br/>

<b>Comment:</b>   Although the bulk of prolapsed disc material is seen at the L4/L5 site, the lesions at the other sites may also be clinically important. This would be especially so if the prolapse at these sites occurred suddenly. Mineralisation however suggests chronic degenerative disc disease and so the process of compression is likely to be gradual. <br/><br/><br/><br/>
