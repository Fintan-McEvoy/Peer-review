<b>Case 10. RTGM24636</b><br/>

<b>History:</b>  Golden retriever. 5 months. Lame (3 weeks) right thoracic limb, pain on manipulation of the elbow.<br/><br/>

<em>Interpretation guide:</em>  Examine elbows only. Try to identify the medial and lateral coronoid process and  the medial and lateral humeral condyle. You can compare right and left in this case.  No disease was identified in the right when these CT images were initially reviewed. Note that there are different reconstructions here, some labeled B80s, others labelled B30s. See if you can identify a difference. We recommend you use the B80s when considering bone. <br/><br/> 



<b>Findings:</b>  	CT elbows and right paw. 1 mm slice thickness. Elbow: There is a 6x2 mm fragment separated from the medial coronoid process of the ulna.<br/></br>

<b>Conclusions:</b>  Fragmented medial coronoid process.<br/><br/><br/><br/>
