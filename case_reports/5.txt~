In one frame of mind try to look at the images with an open mind, not using any prior ideas as to the possible problem and find abnormalities as a result of a careful and complete systematic evaluation of the anatomy displayed in the image. Once this has been done it is often useful to look at the history and clinical signs and consider possible abnormalities. One can then actively search for these very specific changes. This last approach taken alone would be a great error as it will cause you to miss important abnormalities because your are so focused on finding the expected. When done together with a structured systematic a full evaluation results.The technique will likely improve your sensitivity for subtle changes.<br/><br/>
