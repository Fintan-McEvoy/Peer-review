<b>Case 15. RTGM22923</b><br/>

<b>History:</b>   5 year old boxer (35Kg), vomiting once daily for 5 days. This study starts with 3 survey radiographs, followed by 13 images taken at various time points after oral administration of 160ml barium suspension. <br/><br/>

<em>Interpretation guide:</em>   Evaluation of a large series of cases such as this barium study can be made more logical by considering the whole study  as an assessment of anatomy over time. Thus you ask yourself how the stomach looks pre-contrast, immediately after contrast, at 5, 30, 60 etc. minutes after contrast. When evaluating any contrast study pay particular attention to the degree of filling of the cavity concerned, is it complete or are there 'filling defects'? Look at the margin between the contrast and the body surface. For contrast examinations with barium suspension this will always be a mucosal surface. Finally, ask how is the body processing /eliminating the contrast. Is it faster or slower than normal?<br/><br/> 




<b>Findings:</b>  This is a normal study. No abnormality was detected on this image set. You can see gastric filling at time zero, onset of gastric emptying is within 5 minutes of contrast administration, total transit time through the small intestine is 3 hours, total gastric emptying time is less than or equal to 3 hours. <br/></br>

<b>Conclusions:</b>   Normal findings<br/><br/>

<b>Comment:</b>   The last image in the series was taken 5 hours after contrast was administered. If contrast is present in the stomach or small intestine at this stage, it is often useful to obtain 24 hr images. At that stage all contrast should be either in the colon or been excreted with the feces. With disease such as ulceration, contrast can remain adhered to the gastric / small intestinal mucosa, visible on these 24 hr images. GI contrast examinations have become very uncommon and have been largely replaced by ultrasound examinations.<br/><br/><br/><br/>
