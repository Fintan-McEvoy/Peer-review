<b>Case 9. RTGM24570</b><br/>

<b>History:</b>  Castrated male cat 4 years: Episodes of abdominal pain, weight loss, and haematuria (3 months duration). <br/><br/>

<em>Interpretation guide:</em>  Identify as many abdominal structures as you can on these images. In this case, pay particular attention to the kidneys, relate their length to the length of the body of the second lumbar vertebra. The clinician in charge of this case was concerned that there may be urinary calculi (stones) present. Is there any evidence for this?<br/><br/> 




<b>Findings:</b> 	There is bilateral renal enlargement. Normal renal length in a castrated male cat is expected to be less than 2.6 times the length of the body of the second lumbar vertebra. These are approx. 3 X L2. There is a discrete mineral opacity seen ventral to the L4/L5 inter-vertebral disc space. This is seen to be right of the midline. A smaller focal mineral opacity is seen ventral to the body of L6. This is not seen on the VD so it may be midline.  <br/></br>

<b>Conclusions:</b>  Bilateral hydronephrosis and calculi in ureters <br/><br/>

<b>Comment:</b>  Images show bilateral renal enlargement: Bilateral ureteral calculi are possible in this case. (This case had an abdominal ultrasound.  The images are in the hospital PACS, accession number, ULT11594).  <br/><br/><br/><br/>
