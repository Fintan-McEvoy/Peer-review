<b>Case 13. RTGM23921</b><br/>

<b>History:</b>   2 yr old female crossbred. Hit by a car 2 days earlier. Owner noticed an abdominal swelling.<br/><br/>

<em>Interpretation guide:</em>   We usually hope that radiography will add useful information to the case. We should in this case aim to characterize the swelling reported by the owner. What structures are involved? Is the swelling fluid, soft tissue, other ? Look at the images, remember to look at the whole image set.<br/><br/> 




<b>Findings:</b>  There is a ventral abdominal swelling. This contains a mixture of soft tissue, adipose and gas opacities. The outline of the abdominal wall in the area of the swelling is unclear, and is interrupted by fat. The appearance indicates a ventral abdominal wall rupture with displacement of gas-filled bowel and mesentery into the swelling. There is loss of serosal detail. The first lumbar vertebra is transitional, it is associated with a rib-like structure on the left side. This is not likely to be of current clinical significance. <br/></br>

<b>Conclusions:</b>   Ventral abdominal rupture containing gas-filled bowel.<br/><br/>

<b>Comment:</b>  The poor serosal detail might suggest some peritoneal fluid, e.g. blood, urine.  This could be investigated further by abdominal centesis or further imaging.<br/><br/><br/><br/>
