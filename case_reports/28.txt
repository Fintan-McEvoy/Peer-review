<b>Case 28. RTGS2313</b><br/>

<b>History:</b>  Danish Warm blood , 17 years. Fell during competition. Acute carrying leg lameness right fore, crepitus on manipulation of the carpus. <br/><br/>

<em>Interpretation guide:</em>  Detecting fractures in the tarsus and carpus is not always easy. You will need to have a clear understanding of the normal radiographic anatomy on these complicated joints.<br/><br/> 




<b>Findings:</b>   Right fore carpus: 6 projections incl. DorsoProximal-DorsoDistal "skyline" projection of the proximal row of carpal bones. There is a comminuted "slab" fracture of the ulnar carpal bone. This is an articular fracture communicating with the radio-carpal joint and the inter-carpal joint. Some small bone fragments are seen suggesting that this is also a comminuted fracture. There is subluxation / instability of the proximal row of carpal bones. On the lateral projection bone fragments are seen overlying the accessory carpal bone. It is not clear if there are fractures associated with this bone also.<br/></br>

<b>Conclusions:</b>  Fracture ulnar carpal bone<br/><br/><br/><br/>
