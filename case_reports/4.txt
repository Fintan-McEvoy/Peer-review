<b>Case 4. RTGM21893</b><br/>

<b>History:</b>  This dog, during a walk in the forest, jumped on a stick which entered the left chest wall. Owner removed the stick, but in the last 24 hours the dog has become quiet with pale mucus membranes. <br/><br/>

<em>Interpretation guide:</em>   Identify all normal structures and include, as always, an evaluation of the full radiograph (chest wall, cranial abdomen, proximal thoracic limb). If you discover pathology it can often be helpful to look at how adjacent structures have been affected. Have structures been displaced or deformed? Is there border effacement? <br/><br/> 




<b>Findings:</b>  There is an increased soft tissue opacity in the left hemithorax. This appears to compress and deform the left lung lobes. No convincing lung abnormalities detected. Images suggest pleural /sub-pleural accumulation of fluid. This fluid appears to be "contained" as it is not free to move around the pleural space. <br/></br>

<b>Conclusions:</b>  Subpleural bleeding (left side).<br/><br/><br/><br/>
