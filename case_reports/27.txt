<b>Case 27. RTGS1518</b><br/>

<b>History:</b>  Horse, Oldenborg, 3 years. Wound on the lateral aspect of the carpus, presumed recent but duration not known.<br/><br/>

<em>Interpretation guide:</em>   This is a common imaging scenario. The point of the radiographic examination is to determine if there is bone involvement. A fissure fracture will be a serious finding and demand that immediate steps are taken to prevent further damage. Even less severe bone involvement will likely worsen the prognosis compared to a situation where there is no bone involvement. It is unfortunate that the duration of the wound is uncertain in this case as it takes some days for bone lesions to become evident. If radiographs are exposed early in the course of disease, bone involvement may be present but not radiographically visible.<br/><br/> 




<b>Findings:</b>   Five images left carpus: lat, DPal, DLat-PalMed oblique and two Dlat-PalMed. Obl (DM-PaLO): Collimated tightly to the dorsolateral aspect of the distal radial metaphyses. There is a soft tissue swelling containing gas, ca. 2-5 cm proximal to the level of the distal radial physis. The tightly collimated view (DM-PaLO) shows a semicircular line that apparently does not run parallel / together with the surrounding trabeculae. This is a very uncertain finding, but worth following up by means of later images 10 -14 days later for possible sequestrum formation.<br/></br>

<b>Conclusions:</b>  Soft tissue swelling / possible bone involvement.<br/><br/>

<b>Comment:</b>  A follow-up study 14 days later can be seen on the hospital PACS (accession number RTGS1533), and shows definite bone involvement.<br/><br/><br/><br/>
