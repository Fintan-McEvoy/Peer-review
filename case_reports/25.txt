<b>Case 25. RTGS1811</b><br/>

<b>History:</b>  Icelandic horse. Age: 10 years. Deformity of nasal septum seen at endoscopy. Inspiratory sounds suggestive of stenosis. Reduced air-flow of right nostril. Duration: weeks. <br/><br/>

<em>Interpretation guide:</em>  The skull is particularly difficult to evaluate radiographically due to the extent of overlapping structures. A DV or a VD can be particularly useful as there is good left/right symmetry in the region. The clinical findings will suggest a nasal cavity mass. The degree of paranasal sinus involvement and the possible presence of sinus fluid will be of particular interest in this case.<br/><br/> 




<b>Findings:</b>   Three images DV and two lateral projection. Quality and positioning is acceptable. There is a well-circumscribed uniform soft tissue opacity within the maxillary sinuses. The DV-proj. suggests that this is a bilateral process, though a larger region of soft tissue opacity occupies the right side. The base of the vomer bone is thinned but not displaced to either side. This may suggest that this is a bilateral process, squeezing the nasal septum midline. The ethmoid is obscured on the lateral but visible on the DV. The dorsal aspect of the skull is deformed due to thinning and expansion of bone (possible nasal or maxillary bone). There is no evidence to suggest free fluid within the sinuses (gas / fluid interface).<br/></br>

<b>Conclusions:</b>  Sinus cyst<br/><br/>

<b>Comment:</b>  Follow-up images for this case (showing sinusitis after cyst drainage) can be seen on the hospital PACS (accession number RTGS 1989).<br/><br/><br/><br/>
