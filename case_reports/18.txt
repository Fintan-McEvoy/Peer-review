<b>Case 18. RTGM24564</b><br/>

<b>History:</b>   Danish-Swedish farm dog, 5 years, male. This dog shows signs of chronic lumbosacral pain.<br/><br/>

<em>Interpretation guide:</em>  Identify the inter-vertebral discs on both T1 and T2 sequences, first in sagittal, then in transverse planes. Identify and describe significant abnormalities.<br/><br/> 




<b>Findings:</b>  The intervertebral disc at L7/S1 shows signs of degenerative changes. The nucleus pulposus has a low signal on T2 images. The nucleus pulposus projects dorsally. This together with a displaced or hypertrophied annulus project into the spinal canal causing a 50% reduction in diameter with resulting compression of the caudal equina. This compression is mid-sagittal, without lateralization.<br/></br>

<b>Conclusions:</b>   Lumbo-sacral disc disease<br/><br/><br/><br/>
