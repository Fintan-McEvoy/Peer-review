<b>Case 3. RTGM14117</b><br/>

<b>History:</b>  Rottweiler 7 years, collapsed, reduced lung and cardiac sounds.  <br/><br/>

<em>Interpretation guide:</em>   Examining both projections, try to identify normal anatomy and describe features that are abnormal. The absence of a structure that should be seen is a very significant finding. Write a report mentioning the abnormalities. Suggest a location for any abnormality, and if you think there is disease present, try to explain how it could give rise to the radiographic appearance. Be aware of the faulty projection markers.<br/><br/> 




<b>Findings:</b>  	The cardiac and diaphragmatic outlines are not visible. The lung lobes do not project to the edge of the chest wall on either the VD or on the lateral. There is a uniform soft tissue opacity within the pleural space. Inter-lobar fissure lines are seen (these are not normally visible). The tracheal bifurcation is positioned at the T6/T7 level. Images suggest free pleural fluid with partial lung lobe collapse and separation of adjacent lung lobes.<br/></br>

<b>Conclusions:</b>  Hydrothorax - pleural fluid. <br/><br/><br/><br/>
