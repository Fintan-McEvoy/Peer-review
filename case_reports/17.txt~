<b>Case 17. RTGM21426</b><br/>

<b>History:</b>  6 year old male Labrador mix. Slight lameness on both forelimbs for 1 to 2 months. Has been treated with NSAID without any positive effect. Radiographs were obtained from both elbows, shoulders, and left carpus.<br/><br/>

<em>Interpretation guide:</em>  Compare the two elbows and look carefully at the anconeal process on the flexed lateral view, and at the medial joint compartment of the Cranio-Caudal view.<br/><br/> 




<b>Findings:</b>  Left carpus, as well as left and right shoulder are within normal limits. Right elbow: Periarticular new bone formation seen on the anconeal process, cranial radius, and at the region of the medial coronoid process of the ulna. A discrete lucency is seen on the medial humeral condyl, near the joint surface (i.e. subchondral). On the right lateral view (neutral position), the contour of the cranio-proximal part of the coronoid process is not visible. On the same view changes present on the anconeal process are also not visible. Both of these lesions are, however, seen on the flexed lateral view of the same joint. The left elbow shows some slight sclerosis along the anconeal process.<br/></br>

<b>Conclusions:</b>   Severe osteoarthrosis right elbow.</br><br/> 
<b>Comment:</b>  This is likely a sequel to an FCP  and / or OCD lesion.
