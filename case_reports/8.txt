<b>Case 8. RTGM24537</b><br/>

<b>History:</b>  Rottweiler 4 yrs, female entire. Gradual onset signs. Has become aggressive towards other dogs. Eats rapidly, but food is retained in the esophagus. Owners consider that the dog is in pain.<br/><br/>

<em>Interpretation guide:</em>   Dogs such as this having gross radiographic changes can be confusing. It is often useful to search for and comment on structures that you normally expect to find in the abnormal regions. In this case, for example, the changes in the thorax could distract you from important changes in the body wall. Pay particular attention to right ribs 1 to 4.  There is a single series from a CT scan of the thorax in this study.  You can use this to reassess the ribs.<br/><br/>




<b>Findings:</b>  There is a large right sided thoracic mass. This displaces the trachea to the left of the midline (NB normally the trachea passes through the cranial mediastinum on the right side of the midline). The lung lobes are displaced caudally. The mass itself is of uniform soft tissue opacity with no identifiable pulmonary structures. The proximal part of the second rib on the right side appears poorly mineralised in its proximal part near to its articulation with the veretbrae.<br/></br>

<b>Conclusions:</b>  Chest wall soft tissue tumor with possible local invasion to bone. <br/><br/>

<b>Comment:</b>  The possibility of rib lysis is important in this case. It makes the diagnosis of a soft tissue tumor (with local metastasis) highly likely. In cases such as this an early question is the location of the lesion. Eliminating lung as the possible location is not a trivial exercise. In the report the absence of lung markings i.e. air-filled bronchi is important. If these (air-filled small bronchi) were seen the mass would be located in the lung. Their absence means that either the location is not lung or that the mass has caused the airways to fill with fluid e.g. blood. It would, however, still be unusual for a lung mass to invade and partially destroy a rib. A CT series accompanies this case.  This shows the rib lesion clearly.<br/><br/><br/><br/>
