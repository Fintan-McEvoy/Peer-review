<b>Case 23. RTGM26125</b><br/>

<b>History:</b> Labrador retriever 9 years. Incontinent with urine and faeces.  <br/><br/>

<em>Interpretation guide:</em>  Look carefully at series 11, 12, 13, and 14 and at the post contrast images images from series 17,18, and 19. If you see pathology and are considering neoplasia ask yourself if it is likely to be benign or malignant.<br/><br/> 




<b>Findings:</b>  There is a mass lesion involving the body of L5 right side extending into the lamina and the spinal canal - The spinal cord / cauda equina is displaced to the left. The mass lesion is hyper-intense on T2 sequences and enhances on T1 after contrast. There is thinning of the right dorsal lamina of L5. Also present, there is degeneration of the disc at L7/S1, seen as a reduced signal on T2. There is displacement of the epidural fat and of the cauda equina at this L/S site. <br/></br>

<b>Conclusions:</b> Mass 5th lumbar vertebra with cauda equina / cord compression <br/><br/>

It is possible that this is a benign lesions as it has grown into a significantly sized mass but has not spread to adjacent bones or tissues.  The mass effect from lesions that are benign can have serious consequences in locations such as the vertebral canal and the cranial cavity.<br/><br/><br/><br/>
